I am an Artificial Intelligence graduate and Software Engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, data science, and optimization techniques. Currently working as a 
Software Engineer at In.D Solution, I contribute to maintaining and innovating software solutions for industrial machine maker products. I hold multiple professional certifications in Machine 
Learning, Data Engineering, AI applications, and Microsoft Azure AI fundamentals, reflecting my commitment to continuous technical growth.

My academic and project experience includes leading and delivering AI-driven mobile applications, machine learning prediction systems, genetic algorithm optimization projects, and large-scale 
data analytics involving tens of millions of records. I have hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, SQL, and Android development, as well as industry tools such as Power BI, 
SAP Analytics Cloud, and RapidMiner.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring proven leadership experience as a Project Manager and Welfare Executive, having successfully coordinated multidisciplinary teams and international AI events. 
I am passionate about building intelligent, scalable systems and aspire to make meaningful contributions in fast-paced, technology-driven environments, particularly in AI engineering, MLOps, 
and applied machine learning domains.
